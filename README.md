# Autonomous Firefighting Robot Using Arduino Uno R3

## Overview
This project is based on the **LAFVIN Smart Robot Car 2WD Chassis Kit Upgraded V2.0** for Arduino. Modifications have been made to enhance its capabilities for autonomous firefighting applications.
This project is an **Autonomous Firefighting Robot** built using an **Arduino Uno R3**. The robot is designed to detect and extinguish fires using an ultrasonic sensor, motor control, and a water pump system.

## Features
- Fire detection using sensors
- Autonomous navigation with ultrasonic sensors
- Water pump activation for fire suppression
- Motorized movement with obstacle avoidance

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
make
```

## Usage
```bash
# Upload the compiled code to Arduino
make flash
```
